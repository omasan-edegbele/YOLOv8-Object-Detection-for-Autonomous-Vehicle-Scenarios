# 🚘 Autonomous Vehicle Safety Analysis  
### Object Detection & Incident Data Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores **autonomous vehicle safety** through a two-part analytical approach that combines **computer vision** and **data-driven incident analysis**.

- **Part 1** focuses on visual perception by training a **YOLOv8 object detection model** to identify vehicles and road users in traffic scenes.
- **Part 2** analyzes **reported Tesla-related fatalities** using structured incident data to uncover trends in incident severity and occupant outcomes.

Together, these components provide a holistic view of autonomous vehicle safety, linking **machine learning–based perception systems** with **real-world safety data analysis**.
